            <h2>TStep Pyramid of Djoser</h2>
            <img src="/countryInfo/Egypt/Step Pyramid of Djoser.jpg" alt="TStep Pyramid of Djoser">
            <div class="info">
                <p>The Step Pyramid of Djoser, constructed at Saqqara about 4,700 years ago,  was the first pyramid the Egyptians ever built.

                    The ancient Egyptian pharaoh that gave the pyramid its name, Djoser, sometimes spelled Zoser (though he was actually called Netjerykhet) ruled during Egypt's third dynasty. Scholars attribute the planning of the pyramid to Imhotep, a vizier who would later be deified for his accomplishments.
                    
                    "Djoser is the name given to this king by New Kingdom visitors to the site over a thousand years later” wrote Egyptologist Mark Lehner in his book "The Complete Pyramids: Solving The Ancient Mysteries" (Thames & Hudson, 2008). </p>
                <p>The pyramid started off as a mastaba tomb — a flat-roofed structure with sloping sides — and, through a series of expansions, evolved into a 197-foot-high (60 meters) pyramid, with six layers, one built on top of the other. The pyramid was constructed using 11.6 million cubic feet (330,400 cubic meters) of stone and clay. The tunnels beneath the pyramid form a labyrinth about 3.5 miles (5.5 kilometers) long. The pyramid was covered with tura limestone, most of which is gone today.</p>
                <p>In earlier times, pharaohs were buried in smaller mastaba tombs, which robbers could reach by digging in from the top, Reg Clark, an Egyptologist, wrote in his book "Securing Eternity: Ancient Egyptian Tomb Protection from Prehistory to the Pyramids" (American University in Cairo Press, 2019). The Step Pyramid of Djoser, Clark wrote, would have made it almost impossible for a robber to reach the burial chamber by digging in from the top. Protection from grave robbers may be a reason why the ancient Egyptians built the step pyramid, Clark wrote. 

                    While the step pyramid may have offered enhanced protection, people eventually broke into it, and today most of the burial goods, including the mummy of Djoser, are long gone. 
                    
                    Not every mummy has been looted from the tomb, however. Recent archaeological work revealed three mummies dating to the late period (ca. 712–332 B.C.) that were buried inside Djoser's burial chamber, according to a paper published in 2021 in the Journal of the General Union of Arab Archaeologists(opens in new tab). This means that by the late period people had not only broken into the king's burial chamber but were burying more mummies inside of it.<span id="dot">...</span></p>
               
                    <span id="moreContent"> <p> The four free-standing minarets at the corners of the platform added a hitherto unknown dimension
                        to
                        the Mughal architecture. The four minarets provide not only a kind of spatial reference to the
                        monument but also give a three dimensional effect to the edifice.</p>
                    <p>The most impressive in the TStep Pyramid of Djoser complex next to the tomb, is the main gate which stands
                        majestically in the centre of the southern wall of the forecourt. The gate is flanked on the
                        north
                        front by double arcade galleries. The garden in front of the galleries is subdivided into four
                        quarters by two main walk-ways and each quarters in turn subdivided by the narrower cross-axial
                        walkways, on the Timurid-Persian scheme of the walled in garden. The enclosure walls on the east
                        and
                        west have a pavilion at the centre.</p>
                    <p>The pyramid is at the center of a complex 37 acres (15 hectares) in size. A recessed limestone wall surrounds the complex; fake doorways as well as the real colonnade entrances are embedded on the southeast side, wrote Lehner.

                        A temple lies on the north side of the pyramid along with a statue of the king. A small stone structure known as a "serdab" surrounds the statue, with the king's eyes peeking out through a hole in the serdab. To the south of the pyramid lies a great court, with an altar and stones identified as boundary markers, Lehner noted.
                        
                        The builders placed a number of facade "dummy" buildings in the complex, including a series of chapels in the southeast as well as north and south pavilions on the east side of the pyramid. These structures would have served ritual purposes and, curiously, they appear to have been partly buried by their builders, wrote Lehner. In the southeast side of the complex, next to the dummy chapels, lies a court where the king could enact the Heb-Sed jubilee festival, presumably in the afterlife.</p>
                    <p><p><b>Integrity</b></p>

                        Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole TStep Pyramid of Djoser complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of TStep Pyramid of Djoser have been studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.
                        
                        <p><b>Authenticity</b></p>
                        
                        The tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the overall TStep Pyramid of Djoser complex have maintained the conditions of authenticity at the time of inscription. Although an important amount of repairs and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India these have not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation work will need to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design continue to be preserved.
                        
                        <p><b>Protection and management requirements</b></p>
                        
                        The management of TStep Pyramid of Djoser complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around the monument is through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been established, including the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 and Rules 1959 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to the overall administration of the property and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws ensure the protection of the property in terms of development in the surroundings.
                        
                        An area of 10,400 sq km around the TStep Pyramid of Djoser is defined to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use of coal/coke in industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to natural gas or relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments including three World Heritage Sites - TStep Pyramid of Djoser, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.
                        
                        The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation and maintenance of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of the Superintending Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated Management plan is necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions, particularly in the light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need to be adequately managed. The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for proposed infrastructure development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan.</p></span>
