            <h2> Pianosa Island</h2>
            <img src="/countryInfo/Italy/Pianosa Island.webp" alt="Pianosa">
            <div class="info">
                <p>Known since ancient times as Planasia, it was already popular in Roman times, as testified by the underwater archaeological relics that confirm its resence along the trading routes of the classical Mediterranean. In the Middle Ages, Pianosa was contested by Pisa and Genoa until the late 14th century when it passed under Piombino rule, without ever managing to be permanently colonized.
                    From this point on, Pianosa became a penal colony, as instituted by the Grand Duchy of Tuscany in 1856.</p>
                <p>The island was the seat of the penal colony, transformed in 1968 into a maximum security prison that was separated from the small town by a large reinforced concrete wall, until it was definitively closed in 2011. There are still some limitations to the use of Pianosa, however no longer for safety reasons, but due to environmental protection.
                    Since the closure of the penitentiary activities, the Municipality of Campo nell'Elba and the Tuscan Archipelago National Park have developed a project that combines the preservation of the environment with the possibility of discovering the unique Mediterranean island with its particular history.
                    Snorkeling in the surrounding sea is a memorable experience, allowing you to observe cuttlefish, lobsters, sea bream, snapper, moray eels and many other Mediterranean species in shallow water. The seabed is richly covered with Posidonia (seagrass) meadows, fortunately spared from anchoring and trawling. Since 2013, the park has also offered the possibility of scuba diving, by contacting accredited diving centers.</p>
                <p>The coast of Pianosa alternates rocky stretches with splendid bays of sand, the best known of which is Cala San Giovanni (or Cala Giovanna), a charming white sand beach where it's also possible to admire the remains of a Roman villa.
                    Inside the island, walk in the shade of the characteristic dry stone walls, immersed in the Mediterranean scrub, where you can also discover the numerous traces left by the settlements present here since prehistoric times, including a necropolis from the Copper Age and the early Christian catacombs.
                    
                    Once on the island, to receive information on the natural and historical architectural heritage, you can contact the Casa del Parco in Villa Litern<span id="dot">...</span></p>
               
                    <span id="moreContent"> <p>Pianosa is one of the Tuscan islands, gems that are rich in history, Mediterranean nature and sea beds, protected by the Tuscan Archipelago National Park.

                        You can reach Pianosa by starting from Marina di Campo or Rio Marina, on the island of Elba. It's necessary to inquire and book in time, as the number of visitors admitted daily is limited.</p>
                    <p>To get to know the nature, history, traditions and gastronomy of Pianosa and beyond, the Archipelago Park organizes the Walking Festival every year, with a calendar full of events that takes place across the various islands.</p>

                    <p><p><b>Integrity</b></p>

                        Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole Pianosa complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Pianosa have been studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.
                        
                        <p><b>Authenticity</b></p>
                        
                        The tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the overall Pianosa complex have maintained the conditions of authenticity at the time of inscription. Although an important amount of repairs and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India these have not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation work will need to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design continue to be preserved.
                        
                        <p><b>Protection and management requirements</b></p>
                        
                        The management of Pianosa complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around the monument is through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been established, including the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 and Rules 1959 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to the overall administration of the property and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws ensure the protection of the property in terms of development in the surroundings.
                        
                        An area of 10,400 sq km around the Pianosa is defined to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use of coal/coke in industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to natural gas or relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments including three World Heritage Sites - Pianosa, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.
                        
                        The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation and maintenance of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of the Superintending Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated Management plan is necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions, particularly in the light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need to be adequately managed. The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for proposed infrastructure development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan.</p></span>
