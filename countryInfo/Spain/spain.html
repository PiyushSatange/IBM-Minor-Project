                <p>Nothing prepares visitors for the astounding sight of the Seville Cathedral. This glorious monument is Christendom's largest church of Gothic style and the third-largest when compared to the Neoclassical Saint Peter's Basilica in Vatican City and Saint Paul's Cathedral in London.

                    Seville's cathedral awes visitors with its sheer size and Gothic splendor. Its interior could easily fit a football stadium, and the 30-meter-tall main altarpiece is gilded with the finest gold brought back from the New World during the age of Christopher Columbus.</p>
                <p>A symbol of the Christian Reconquest over the Moors, the cathedral was constructed between 1401 and 1506 on the site of the town's 12th-century Great Mosque. The cathedral has been designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site, reflecting its cultural and historic importance.

                    Visitors could spend a few hours discovering the grandiose sanctuary, the chapels adorned with masterpieces of Spanish painting, and the treasury containing precious religious objects. A highlight is the Giralda Tower, which affords sensational panoramic views of the city.
                    
                    Learn about the artistic and architectural highlights of the Seville Cathedral. Our Visitor's Guide provides historical context as well as practical tips, such as things to do in the area, so that you can get the most out of your sightseeing experience.</p>
                <p>Seville Cathedral (Catedral de Sevilla) is an impressive gothic structure and, with a total area of 11,520 square metres, is only beaten in size by London’s St Paul’s Cathedral and Rome’s St. Peter’s, making it the third largest cathedral in the world, and the world’s largest Gothic cathedral. Some even argue that it is actually the largest when comparing volume.<span id="dot">...</span></p>
               
                    <span id="moreContent"> <p>Construction of Seville Cathedral took just over a century, spanning from 1402 to 1506. However, the intention and first steps towards building the cathedral can be traced back to 1248, when Seville was conquered by Fernando III of Castile, who is buried there.

                        Seville Cathedral took the place of the Almohad Mosque, which had stood on the site previously but had been damaged by an earthquake in 1356. Its construction was funded by Seville’s citizens, who were determined to create a magnificent place of worship which, records show, was supposed to be “so beautiful and so great that those who see it built will think we were mad”.
                        
                        In fact, elements of the original mosque are still visible, particularly in the fact that the church was built to follow its square shape and because the architects preserved the Moorish entrance and the bell tower called the Giralda, which tourists can climb for fantastic views.
                        
                        Designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1987, Seville Cathedral is an incredible historic site where visitors can appreciate the sheer scale of the building from inside, including its central nave which stands at a grand forty metres high. With its ornate, gold-laden interiors and eighty chapels, the scale of Seville Cathedral alone is quite a sight, coupled with the wealth of architectural influences, ranging from Gothic and Baroque to Mudejar.</p>
                    <p>The main things to see at Seville Cathedral include its stunning stained glass windows, the organ and the Royal Chapel. The tomb of Christopher Columbus also offers a big draw to tourists, who flock to see the final resting place of this famous explorer.

                        The cathedral is open year-round (Sunday afternoons only), but hours vary depending on the season. It’s worth paying extra for the guided rooftop tour, which has excellent views across the city. Audio guides cost an additional €3 and are worth it if you’re have more than a surface level of interest in the cathedral.</p>
                    <p>The Seville Cathedral is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry
                        along
                        a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is
                        brick-in-lime
                        mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones.
                        The
                        mosque and the guest house in the Seville Cathedral complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to
                        the
                        marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their
                        front.
                        Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive
                        prayer
                        hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of
                        the
                        portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with
                        flowery
                        arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding.</p>
                    <p><p><b>Integrity</b></p>

                        Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole Seville Cathedral complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Seville Cathedral have been studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.
                        
                        <p><b>Authenticity</b></p>
                        
                        The tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the overall Seville Cathedral complex have maintained the conditions of authenticity at the time of inscription. Although an important amount of repairs and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India these have not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation work will need to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design continue to be preserved.
                        
                        <p><b>Protection and management requirements</b></p>
                        
                        The management of Seville Cathedral complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around the monument is through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been established, including the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 and Rules 1959 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to the overall administration of the property and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws ensure the protection of the property in terms of development in the surroundings.
                        
                        An area of 10,400 sq km around the Seville Cathedral is defined to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use of coal/coke in industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to natural gas or relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments including three World Heritage Sites - Seville Cathedral, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.
                        
                        The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation and maintenance of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of the Superintending Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated Management plan is necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions, particularly in the light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need to be adequately managed. The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for proposed infrastructure development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan.</p></span>
