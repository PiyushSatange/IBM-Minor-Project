            <h2>Nîmes Arena</h2>
            <img src="/countryInfo/France/Nîmes Arena.jpg" alt="Nimes Arena">
            <div class="info">
                <p>Built during the reign of the Emperor Augustus in the 1st century, Nimes Arena was a marvel of Roman engineering with its stunning façade of archways and ornamentation. A vast oval amphitheatre reminiscent of the Colosseum, Nimes Arena could seat up to 24,000 people in its 34 terraces.

                    The citizens of Nimes-then called Nemausus-would sit according to their social status and watch the games played there, ranging from animal hunts involving lions, tigers, and even elephants to the famous gladiatorial matches. Executions would also take place at the Arena, with those condemned to death being thrown to the animals.
                    
                    In the 6th century Nimes Arena began to play a military role under the Visigoths. Transformed from a sports arena to a castle fortress or “castrum arena”, it acted as an emergency shelter for the town's inhabitants in the event of attack, and featured a large moat to help keep enemy forces out.
                    
                    Nimes Arena would go on to play an even more elaborate role in the 12th century when it became the seat of the Viscount of Nimes and home to a chateau, and soon a small residential neighbourhood had grown up inside its walls. In the 18th century, around 150 houses remained inside Nimes Arena, which in 1786 were demolished to revert the site to its original Roman grandeur.</p>
                <p>The Nimes Arena is considered to be the greatest architectural achievement in the whole range of
                    Indo-Islamic architecture. Its recognised architectonic beauty has a rhythmic combination of solids
                    and voids, concave and convex and light shadow; such as arches and domes further increases the
                    aesthetic aspect. The colour combination of lush green scape reddish pathway and blue sky over it
                    show cases the monument in ever changing tints and moods. The relief work in marble and inlay with
                    precious and semi precious stones make it a monument apart. </p>
                <p>The uniqueness of Nimes Arena lies in some truly remarkable innovations carried out by the horticulture
                    planners and architects of Shah Jahan. One such genius planning is the placing of tomb at one end of
                    the quadripartite garden rather than in the exact centre, which added rich depth and perspective to
                    the distant view of the monument. It is also, one of the best examples of raised tomb variety. The
                    tomb is further raised on a square platform with the four sides of the octagonal base of the
                    minarets extended beyond the square at the corners. The top of the platform is reached through a
                    lateral flight of steps provided in the centre of the southern side. The ground plan of the Taj
                    Mahal is in perfect balance of composition, the octagonal tomb chamber in the centre, encompassed by
                    the portal halls and the four corner rooms. The plan is repeated on the upper floor. The exterior of
                    the tomb is square in plan, with chamfered corners. The large double storied domed chamber, which
                    houses the cenotaphs of Mumtaz Mahal and Shah Jahan, is a perfect octagon in plan. The exquisite
                    octagonal marble lattice screen encircling both cenotaphs is a piece of superb workmanship. It is
                    highly polished and richly decorated with inlay work. The borders of the frames are inlaid with
                    precious stones representing flowers executed with wonderful perfection. The hues and the shades of
                    the stones used to make the leaves and the flowers appear almost real. The cenotaph of Mumtaz Mahal
                    is in perfect centre of the tomb chamber, placed on a rectangular platform decorated with inlaid
                    flower plant motifs. The cenotaph of Shah Jahan is greater than Mumtaz Mahal and installed more than
                    thirty years later by the side of the latter on its west. The upper cenotaphs are only illusory and
                    the real graves are in the lower tomb chamber (crypt), a practice adopted in the imperial Mughal
                    tombs.<span id="dot">...</span></p>
               
                    <span id="moreContent"> <p>Now fully restored, Nimes Arena is a popular tourist attraction and allows visitors a glimpse into the dramatic world of the Roman amphitheatre. Including an interactive audio guide and detailed exhibits, the site is not only a marvel but is also highly informative and perfect for fans of ancient history.

                        Beyond its historic significance Nimes Arena is also still used for events today, including two biannual bullfights that take place during the Feria de Nimes, and reenactment events such as the 'Great Roman Games'.</p>
                    <p>Nimes Arena is located in southern France in the centre of Nimes, and can be accessed via the N106 or N113 roads. Parking is available next to the site at Parking Indigo Nimes Arenes.

                        Nimes train station is a 7-minute walk away, and Nimes bus and coach station is a 30-minute walk away.</p>
                    <p>The Nimes Arena is a perfect symmetrical planned building, with an emphasis of bilateral symmetry
                        along
                        a central axis on which the main features are placed. The building material used is
                        brick-in-lime
                        mortar veneered with red sandstone and marble and inlay work of precious/semi precious stones.
                        The
                        mosque and the guest house in the Nimes Arena complex are built of red sandstone in contrast to
                        the
                        marble tomb in the centre. Both the buildings have a large platform over the terrace at their
                        front.
                        Both the mosque and the guest house are the identical structures. They have an oblong massive
                        prayer
                        hall consist of three vaulted bays arranged in a row with central dominant portal. The frame of
                        the
                        portal arches and the spandrels are veneered in white marble. The spandrels are filled with
                        flowery
                        arabesques of stone intarsia and the arches bordered with rope molding.</p>
                    <p><p><b>Integrity</b></p>

                        Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole Nimes Arena complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Nimes Arena have been studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.
                        
                        <p><b>Authenticity</b></p>
                        
                        The tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the overall Nimes Arena complex have maintained the conditions of authenticity at the time of inscription. Although an important amount of repairs and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India these have not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation work will need to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design continue to be preserved.
                        
                        <p><b>Protection and management requirements</b></p>
                        
                        The management of Nimes Arena complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around the monument is through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been established, including the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 and Rules 1959 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to the overall administration of the property and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws ensure the protection of the property in terms of development in the surroundings.
                        
                        An area of 10,400 sq km around the Nimes Arena is defined to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use of coal/coke in industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to natural gas or relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments including three World Heritage Sites - Nimes Arena, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.
                        
                        The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation and maintenance of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of the Superintending Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated Management plan is necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions, particularly in the light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need to be adequately managed. The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for proposed infrastructure development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan.</p></span>
