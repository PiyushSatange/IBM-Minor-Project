                <p>Port Arthur is a small town and former penal colony on the Tasman Peninsula in Tasmania, Australia. It is considered one of the country's most significant heritage areas and Tasmania's top tourist attraction. It is located approximately 60 kilometers (37 mi) southeast of the state capital, Hobart. It is known for its harsh conditions, dark history and stark beauty. From a distance Port Arthur looks idyllic - beautiful buildings amid lush greenery and beautifully landscaped gardens. This setting, however, belies a dark history. The British Empire founded Port Arthur as a penal colony, which functioned as such for nearly 50 years. Port Arthur was also the site of the "Separate Prison" - sometimes known as The Model Prison - which served as a model of prison reform, implementing psychological rather than physical methods of punishment.</p>
                <p>Tasmania is an Australian island and a state of the same name, separated from the Australian mainland by the Bass Strait, a 240 kilometers (150 mi) wide stretch of water. Tasmania is known for its extreme natural beauty with spectacular mountain, lake, and coastal scenery. Nearly 37 percent of the state is protected in Nature Reserves and National Parks, including more than one fifth which is designated as UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

                    A settlement was established by Captain David Collins in 1804, in Sullivan's Cove in the estuary of the Derwent River on the island's southeast coast. This settlement became known as Hobart Town or Hobarton, later shortened to Hobart, now the state capital. Port Arthur is located approximately 80 kilometers (50 mi) southeast of Hobart. At the 2006 census, Port Arthur and the surrounding area had a population of 499.</p>
                <p>Port Arthur was named after Van Diemen's Land lieutenant governor George Arthur. The settlement started as a timber station in 1830, but it is best known for being a penal colony.

                    From 1833 until the 1850s, it was a destination for the hardest of convicted British and Irish criminals, those who were secondary offenders having re-offended after their arrival in Australia. Rebellious personalities from other convict stations were also sent here, a quite undesirable punishment.
                    
                    The period from settlement in 1830, to 1840, consisted of the penal station being hacked from the bush and industries established. Ship building, shoemaking, smithing, timber and brick making enterprises were begun. During the 1840s there was a consolidation of the industrial and penal nature of the settlement as the convict population reached over 1100. In 1842 a huge flour mill and granary was begun, as well as the construction of a hospital. Later that year bricks were laid for the penitentiary.<span id="dot">...</span></p>
               
                    <span id="moreContent"> <p>The "Separate Prison" of Port Arthur, based upon the model of Pentonville prison in London, was begun in 1848. The 80 cell prison was built in the shape of a cross with radial exercise yards around a central hall and chapel.[2] Port Arthur also expanded geographically at this time as the convicts pushed further into the encircling hills to extract the valuable timber. The transition to the Separate Prison system brought a shift in punishment from physical to psychological methods. It was believed that the hard corporal punishment, such as whippings, used in other penal stations only served to harden criminals, and did nothing to turn them from their immoral ways. Under this system of punishment the "Silent System" was implemented in the building. Here prisoners were hooded and made to stay silent, this was intended to allow time for the prisoner to reflect upon the actions which had brought him there. In many ways Port Arthur was the pin-up for many in the penal reform movement, despite shipping, housing and slave-labor use of convicts being as harsh, or worse, than others stations around Australia.</p>
                    <p>Port Arthur had some of the newest and strictest security measures of the Australian penal system. It was secured naturally by shark-infested waters on three sides. The 30 meters (98 ft) wide isthmus of Eaglehawk Neck that connected it to the mainland was crossed by fences and guarded by prison guards and dogs. Contact between visiting seamen and prisoners was barred. Ships were required to check in their sails and oars upon landing to prevent any unnotified leavings. In 1836, a tramway was established between Taranna and a jetty in Long Bay, north of Port Arthur. The sole means of propulsion was convicts.</p>
                    <p>Port Arthur was also the destination for juvenile convicts, receiving many boys, some as young as nine years of age, arrested for stealing toys. The boys were separated from the main convict population and kept on Point Puer, the British Empire's first boys' prison. Like the adults, the boys were used in hard labor such as stone cutting and construction. One of the buildings constructed was one of Australia's first non-denominational churches, built in a gothic style. Attendance of the weekly Sunday service was compulsory for the prison population; critics of the new system noted that this and other measures seemed to have negligible impact on reformation. Despite its badge as a pioneer in the new nicer age of imprisonment, Port Arthur was still as harsh and brutal as other penal settlements. Some critics might even suggest that its use of psychological punishment, compounded with no hope of escape, made it one of the worst.</p>
                    <p><p><b>Integrity</b></p>

                        Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole Port Arthur complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Port Arthur have been studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.
                        
                        <p><b>Authenticity</b></p>
                        
                        The tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the overall Port Arthur complex have maintained the conditions of authenticity at the time of inscription. Although an important amount of repairs and conservation works have been carried out right from the British period in India these have not compromised to the original qualities of the buildings. Future conservation work will need to follow guidelines that ensure that qualities such as form and design continue to be preserved.
                        
                        <p><b>Protection and management requirements</b></p>
                        
                        The management of Port Arthur complex is carried out by the Archaeological Survey of India and the legal protection of the monument and the control over the regulated area around the monument is through the various legislative and regulatory frameworks that have been established, including the Ancient Monument and Archaeological Sites and Remains Act 1958 and Rules 1959 Ancient Monuments and Archaeological Sites and Remains (Amendment and Validation); which is adequate to the overall administration of the property and buffer areas. Additional supplementary laws ensure the protection of the property in terms of development in the surroundings.
                        
                        An area of 10,400 sq km around the Port Arthur is defined to protect the monument from pollution. The Supreme Court of India in December, 1996, delivered a ruling banning use of coal/coke in industries located in the Taj Trapezium Zone (TTZ) and switching over to natural gas or relocating them outside the TTZ. The TTZ comprises of 40 protected monuments including three World Heritage Sites - Port Arthur, Agra Fort and Fatehpur Sikri.
                        
                        The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the buffer areas. The fund provided by the federal government is adequate for the overall conservation, preservation and maintenance of the complex to supervise activities at the site under the guidance of the Superintending Archaeologist of the Agra Circle. The implementation of an Integrated Management plan is necessary to ensure that the property maintains the existing conditions, particularly in the light of significant pressures derived from visitation that will need to be adequately managed. The Management plan should also prescribe adequate guidelines for proposed infrastructure development and establish a comprehensive Public Use plan.</p></span>
