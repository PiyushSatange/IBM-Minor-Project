            <h2>Aphrodisias</h2>
            <img src="/countryInfo/Turkey/Aphrodisias.jpg" alt="Aphrodisias">
            <div class="info">
                <p>Located in southwestern Turkey, in the upper valley of the Morsynus River, the site consists of two
                    components: the archaeological site of Aphrodisias and the marble quarries northeast of the city.
                    The temple of Aphrodite dates from the 3rd century BC and the city was built one century later. The
                    wealth of Aphrodisias came from the marble quarries and the art produced by its sculptors. The city
                    streets are arranged around several large civic structures, which include temples, a theatre, an
                    agora and two bath complexes.</p>
                <p>Aphrodisias is located in southwestern Turkey, in the fertile valley formed by the Morsynus River, in
                    the ancient region of Caria. The serial property consists of two components. The first component
                    encompasses the archaeological site of Aphrodisias following the city walls that encircle the city;
                    and the second component includes the marble quarries located northeast of the city. Aphrodisias was
                    founded as a city-state in the early 2nd century BC. An orthogonal street grid defines the pattern
                    of the city; only a few structures, such as the temple of the goddess Aphrodite, are not aligned
                    with the grid. Because the city shared a close interest in the goddess Aphrodite with Sulla, Julius
                    Caesar and the emperor Augustus, Aphrodisias came to have a close relationship with Rome. It
                    obtained a privileged ‘tax-free’ political status from the Roman senate, and developed a strong
                    artistic, sculptural tradition during the Imperial Period. Many elaborately decorated structures
                    were erected during the period of Roman rule, all made from the local marble.</p>
                <p>The Cult of Aphrodite was the most important cult of Aphrodisias. The sanctuary at Aphrodisias had a
                    distinctive cult statue of Aphrodite which defined the city’s identity. The Aphrodite of Aphrodisias
                    combined aspects of a local Anatolian, archaic fertility goddess with those of the Hellenic
                    Aphrodite, goddess of love and beauty. This identifying image has been found from Anatolia across
                    the Mediterranean, from the city of Rome to the Levant. The importance of the Aphrodite of
                    Aphrodisias continued well beyond official imperial acceptance of Christianity; the Temple did not
                    become a church until c. AD 500.<span id="dot">...</span></p>

                <span id="moreContent">
                    <p>The proximity of the marble quarries to the city was a major reason that Aphrodisias became an
                        outstanding high-quality production centre for marble sculpture. Sculptors from the city were
                        famous throughout the Roman Empire. They were well-known for virtuoso portrait sculpture and
                        Hellenistic-style statues of gods and Dionysian figures. In late antiquity (4th-6th centuries
                        AD), Aphrodisian sculptors were in great demand for marble portrait busts and statues of
                        emperors, governors and philosophers in the major centres of the empire – for example, at
                        Sardis, Stratonikeia, Laodikeia, Constantinople and Rome. In this period they were the best
                        carvers of marble statues of their day. The techniques used, the quality of local artistic
                        design, and the production of advanced portrait sculpture gave Aphrodisias a unique place in the
                        Roman world.</p>
                    <p>Another key aspect of Aphrodisias was its cosmopolitan social structure (Greek, Roman, Carian,
                        pagan, Jewish, Christian) that is abundantly articulated in the site’s 2,000 surviving
                        inscriptions.

                        The exceptional production of sculpted marble at Aphrodisias blends local, Greek, and Roman
                        traditions, themes and iconography. It is visible throughout the city in an impressive variety
                        of forms, from large decorated architectural blocks to larger than life-size statues to small
                        portable votive figures. The proximity of good quarries with both pure white and grey marbles
                        was a strong catalyst for the swift development of the city as a noted centre for marble-carving
                        and marble-carvers. The ability of Aphrodisian sculptors was sought after in metropolitan Rome
                        where signatures of Aphrodisian sculptors appear on some of the finest surviving works – for
                        example, from Hadrian’s Villa at Tivoli. These sculptors were major participants in the Empire’s
                        art market between the 1st and 5th centuries AD.</p>
                    <p>Aphrodisias occupies a pre-eminent place in the study of sculpture in the Roman world. Its
                        quarries and its sculpture workshops made it a major art centre, famous for the creativity and
                        technical skill of its sculptors. Aphrodisias has one of the very few known and systematically
                        excavated sculpture workshops of the Roman Empire, which provides a fuller understanding of the
                        production of marble sculpture than anywhere else in the Roman world.</p>
                    <p>
                    <p><b>Integrity</b></p>

                    Integrity is maintained in the intactness of tomb, mosque, guest house, main gate and the whole
                    Aphrodisias complex. The physical fabric is in good condition and structural stability, nature of
                    foundation, verticality of the minarets and other constructional aspects of Aphrodisias have been
                    studied and continue to be monitored. To control the impact of deterioration due for atmospheric
                    pollutants, an air control monitoring station is installed to constantly monitor air quality and
                    control decay factors as they arise. To ensure the protection of the setting, the adequate
                    management and enforcement of regulations in the extended buffer zone is needed. In addition, future
                    development for tourist facilities will need to ensure that the functional and visual integrity of
                    the property is maintained, particularly in the relationship with the Agra Fort.

                    <p><b>Authenticity</b></p>

                    The authenticity of the serial property is established through its quarries, monuments and
                    sculptures, about 2,000 surviving inscriptions, a comprehensively studied history and a substantial
                    body of published research. The work of conservation and restoration at Aphrodisias has been
                    undertaken in conformity with the Charter of Venice, respecting their original designs and building
                    materials. The landscape surrounding Aphrodisias has not been exposed to modern development or to
                    mass tourism.

                    <p><b>Protection and management requirements</b></p>

                    Legal protection of the property has been provided by the Act on the Conservation of Cultural and
                    Natural Property No. 2863 since 1978 for the ancient city and since 1981 for the quarries. By the
                    decision No. 5580 of the Aydin Regional Conservation Council in 2016, legal protection has been
                    strengthened for the quarries. Legal protection should be extended for the entirety of the buffer
                    zone. The patrols by the local gendarmerie should be expanded in order to include the quarry
                    component as well as the buffer zone.

                    The Ministry of Culture and Tourism with its central and local branches and the excavation team are
                    the main bodies responsible for the conservation, protection, promotion and management of the site.
                    Integration of the local community into the management system of the property needs to be
                    strengthened.
                    The archaeological site is excavated, researched and conserved by the excavation team which is
                    authorized by the government on an annual basis, and its work is regularly monitored by the Ministry
                    of Culture and Tourism.

                    A Conservation Plan for the city component was prepared, and approved by the Aydin Regional
                    Conservation Council in 2002. A full 3D inventory of the quarry faces should be conducted in order
                    to provide a baseline record of their condition. There is a need for formulation and implementation
                    of monitoring indicators for the quarry component as well as implementation of remedial conservation
                    measures.
                    The Aphrodisias Management Plan, prepared under the supervision of the Ministry of Culture and
                    Tourism with the support of Geyre Foundation, was approved on 17 September 2013 and its
                    implementation is followed by the Advisory Board and the Supervision and Coordination Board, as well
                    as the site manager appointed by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. Both the conservation and
                    management plans should be updated to reflect the extent of the property at the time of inscription.

                    Flooding in winter and wildfire in summer are the major natural risks to the property. For the
                    prevention of flooding, a drainage plan within the walled city should be quickly implemented.

                    Also, a fire response plan and training in fire suppression should be developed. Mobile water tanks
                    should be placed within the city during the summer as an interim measure until a permanent fire
                    suppression system is installed.</p>
